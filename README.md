Comparison: Which is Better, Q-learning or Value Iteration?
For this grid-based environment, Value Iteration (MDP) tends to be more efficient and effective if the environment dynamics (rewards, penalties, transitions) are fully known. Here's why:

Optimal Policy Guarantee: Value Iteration computes the optimal policy by directly maximizing future rewards based on the environment model. It is ideal when the agent has complete knowledge of rewards and transition probabilities.
Convergence Speed: Value Iteration often converges faster in grid worlds since it doesn't rely on exploration and can make deterministic decisions.
Model Requirements: Q-learning, being model-free, can be advantageous in dynamic or unknown environments where rewards may change over time. However, in this static grid environment, the direct optimization of Value Iteration leads to a more reliable path to the goal.
Repository Description: Grid Environment Comparison of Q-learning and Value Iteration (MDP)
This repository contains a Python implementation and comparison of two reinforcement learning methods—Q-learning and Value Iteration (MDP)—in a grid-based environment. The project creates random grids with rewards, penalties, and a goal, allowing both algorithms to determine an optimal policy for reaching the goal while maximizing cumulative rewards.

Key Components
Random Grid Generation: Each environment is generated with random rewards and penalties, alongside a goal cell that provides a high reward.
Q-learning: A model-free, off-policy method where the agent learns through exploration, updating its Q-table values over episodes to maximize future rewards.
Value Iteration (MDP): A model-based, on-policy method that calculates optimal values for each state, finding the best actions using known environment dynamics.
Visualization: The repository includes a plotting utility to display the grid, along with the policies learned by each method, with color-coded legends to easily interpret actions.
Usage
Run benchmark() to generate a random grid and compare the policies from Q-learning and Value Iteration.
Use run_benchmark_multiple_grids() to test the algorithms on multiple random grids, and plot_policies() to visualize the results.
Comparison Notes
Q-learning is advantageous in dynamic environments where the agent has no prior knowledge and must learn by trial and error.
Value Iteration performs better in static, fully-known environments, converging faster to an optimal policy.

This repository provides an educational resource for understanding how these algorithms work in grid environments and their suitability for different types of environments.
